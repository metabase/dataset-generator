  return `You are a data architect designing a hyper-realistic dataset specification for a '${businessType}' business.

**Your Goal**: Define a realistic schema and simulation logic for generating synthetic analytics-ready data that data analysts can immediately use for business intelligence, reporting, and advanced analytics.

**CRITICAL: Raw Data for Analyst Practice**
- Generate **raw, unaggregated event-level data** - NOT pre-calculated metrics or summaries
- Analysts need to practice: GROUP BY, SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), JOINs, window functions, etc.
- Data should be perfect for creating charts, dashboards, and visualizations
- Include all necessary context fields so analysts can slice and dice the data
- Focus on individual transactions, events, or records that can be aggregated later
- **Do not include columns for pre-aggregated values (e.g., acv, mrr, totals, averages, etc). Only include the raw columns needed to calculate them.**

**CRITICAL: Realistic Values and Business Logic**
- **NEVER use 0 for realistic prices** - use the pricing guidelines provided
- **Ensure mathematical consistency** - totals should equal sums of components
- **Use realistic frequencies** - events should occur at believable rates
- **Include proper business relationships** - foreign keys, status flows, etc.
- **Provide rich context** - analysts need dimensions to filter and group by

**CRITICAL: Adapt to User Context**
- If the user specifies a particular business context (e.g., "B2B SaaS for construction management"), adapt your schema to that specific domain
- Use the business type guidance as a starting point, but customize entities, events, and relationships for the specific use case
- Ensure all generated data reflects the actual business operations described by the user

**CRITICAL: Use correct faker method names:**
- For names: use "person.fullName" (not "person.name")
- For emails: use "internet.email" (not "email")
- For product names: use "commerce.productName" (not "commerce.product_name")
- For prices: use "commerce.price" (not "commerce.price")
- For categories: use "commerce.department" (not "commerce.category")
- For numbers: use "number.int" (not "random.number")

**Schema Requirements:**${schemaSection}

**Analyst-Friendly Data Structure:**
- **Event-Level Records**: Each row represents a single event, transaction, or interaction
- **Rich Context**: Include entity attributes (customer info, product details, etc.) for easy filtering and grouping
- **No Pre-Aggregations**: Avoid calculated totals, averages, or summaries - let analysts compute these
- **Visualization-Ready**: Include date/time fields, categorical dimensions, and numeric measures
- **Join-Friendly**: Ensure proper foreign keys and relationships for complex analysis

**Simulation Logic Guidelines:**
- **Initial Events**: Define the starting point for each entity (e.g., signup, first purchase)
  - Use realistic frequencies: 0.05-0.2 avg_per_entity_per_month for new entities
- **Recurring Events**: Use \`frequency: { "on": "entity.attribute" }\` to control periodicity
  - Examples: billing_cycle for subscriptions, maintenance_schedule for equipment
- **Random Events**: Use \`avg_per_entity_per_month\` for engagement events
  - High frequency: 20-100 (logins, views, small transactions)
  - Medium frequency: 5-20 (purchases, feature usage, assignments)
  - Low frequency: 0.5-5 (reviews, upgrades, major events)
- **Churn Events**: Use \`monthly_rate\` for cancellations or departures
  - Typical rates: 0.01-0.05 (1-5% monthly churn)
  - High churn: 0.05-0.15 (5-15% monthly churn)

**CRITICAL Consistency Rules:**
- **Use realistic pricing**: Follow the pricing guidelines for each business type
- **Ensure mathematical consistency**: totals = sums of components
- **Use consistent value formatting**: numbers without quotes (e.g., 49, not "49")
- **Standardize field names**: Use consistent casing (e.g., snake_case for all)
- **Reference format**: Always use \`entity.attribute\` format for clarity
- **Realistic values**: Never use random strings or generic codes for business fields
- **Raw data focus**: Generate individual records, not summaries or aggregations

**CRITICAL: Business Type Validation**
- **B2B SaaS**: Must include user_id, company_id, user_role, subscription_plan, billing_cycle, plan_price, contract_value. NEVER include product_id, product_name, category
- **B2C SaaS**: Must include user_id, user_age, device_type, subscription_plan, billing_cycle, plan_price. NEVER include product_id, product_name, category, company_id
